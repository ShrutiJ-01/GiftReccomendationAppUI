Introduction
 Many people struggle to find the best gift for their friends. Even though a myriad of products are available to them through the internet and eCommerce websites, it is not easy to decide what would satiate the receiver's interests perfectly. This project aims to develop a gift recommendation application that best suits the interests of their friends, the occasion, and the purpose of the gift. We have developed an app that asks the user a few questions about the person he intends to gift. Then, the app recommends gifts based on parameters like
Age
Gender
Occasion
Interests
Relationship of the gift giver with the receiver.
As of now, the gift suggestions consist of the list of 66 products. The products range from fashion accessories, clothing, and electronic gadgets to cookware and home appliances suggested according to the data entered by the user.
